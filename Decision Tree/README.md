This README sepcifies the usage of the Python code for decision tree.

In both the 'Car Example'(folder) ans the 'Bank Example', to build the decision tree, run the function "tree = tree_build(mylist_train, Lev)" in which 'mylist_train' is the training data stored in a list, and 'Lev' is the deepth of the tree, which is adjustable. The returned values 'tree' is the root node represented by a dictionary.
